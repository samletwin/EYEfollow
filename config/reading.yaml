  grade_7:
    message: Elephants, the largest terrestrial mammals, are native to the continents of Africa and Asia. Their most 
             distinctive feature, the trunk, serves as a multi-purpose tool for feeding, drinking, and communication. 
             Elephants are herbivores and play a key role in their ecosystems by shaping their environments. Highly social 
             animals, elephants live in family groups led by a matriarch, and their bonds with one another are profound.

  grade_8:
    message: Elephants, the largest land mammals, are known for their intelligence, strong social bonds, and unique physical 
             characteristics, especially their trunks and tusks. They are herbivores that play a crucial role in maintaining 
             the balance of their ecosystems by uprooting trees and dispersing seeds. Elephants live in matriarchal herds, 
             which are often led by the oldest and wisest female, and they exhibit behaviors that show empathy, cooperation, 
             and memory.
    questions:
      1: What are some behaviors that show elephant empathy?
      2: How do elephants contribute to their ecosystems?
      3: What does it mean for a herd to be matriarchal?
      4: In what ways do elephants demonstrate intelligence?
      5: How do elephants disperse seeds?
  grade_9:
    message: Elephants are the largest land animals, and their presence is vital to the ecosystems they inhabit. Found in both 
             Africa and Asia, these herbivorous mammals use their trunks not only to gather food and water but also to communicate 
             and express emotions. Elephants live in complex social structures, primarily female-led herds, where they cooperate 
             to care for the young and protect one another. Their behavior shows remarkable intelligence, memory, and emotional 
             depth.
    questions:
      1: What does it mean that elephants live in complex social structures?
      2: How do elephants express their emotions?

  grade_10:
    message: Elephants are the world's largest terrestrial animals, native to Africa and Asia, and are essential keystone species 
             in their environments. These herbivores use their trunks as versatile tools for feeding, drinking, and social interaction, 
             while their tusks are used for digging and defense. Elephants display sophisticated social structures, often led by a 
             matriarch, and they exhibit behaviors that suggest high cognitive abilities, such as problem-solving, mourning, and 
             complex communication. Despite their importance, elephants face significant threats from poaching and habitat loss, 
             making conservation efforts crucial for their survival.
    questions:
      1: What are the implications of elephants being keystone species?
      2: How do elephants use their tusks, and why are they important?
      3: Discuss the cognitive abilities demonstrated by elephants.
      4: What conservation efforts are important for the survival of elephants?
      5: How does habitat loss affect elephant populations?
